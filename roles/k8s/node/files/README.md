# README
The `containerd_config.toml` was generated by the command `containerd config default`.  The file should be placed `/etc/containerd/config.toml` for containerd to pick up default.  The documentation for this was found at <https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md>.
